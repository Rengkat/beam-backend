# Simple Fintech Application

This project is a simple fintech application designed to provide core functionalities for user account management, financial transactions, and balance tracking. The application consists of a backend API built with Node.js and Express, and a frontend built with React.js.

## Features

* **User Account Management:**
    * User registration, login, and authentication (using JWT).
    * Secure password hashing.
    * Storage of user data (name, email, password hash).
* **Transaction Management:**
    * Perform deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
    * Record transaction details (amount, type, timestamp, sender/receiver).
    * Automatic account balance updates upon transaction completion.
* **Balance Management:**
    * Track and update user balances in real-time.
    * Endpoints to view the current user balance.
* **Database Integration:**
    * Utilizes PostgreSQL for relational data storage (users, transactions).
    * Ensures data consistency and integrity, including handling insufficient funds for withdrawals.
* **API Endpoints:**
    * RESTful API endpoints for managing users and transactions.
    * Input validation and comprehensive error handling.
* **Swagger API Documentation:**
    * Interactive API documentation using Swagger UI for easy testing and understanding of endpoints.

## Technologies Used

**Backend:**

* Node.js
* Express.js
* PostgreSQL (Database)
* JWT (for Authentication)
* Bcrypt (for Password Hashing)

**Frontend:**

* React.js (with TypeScript)
* Context API / Redux (for State Management)
* Axios (for API Calls)
* Responsive Design

## Setup and Installation

*(Provide brief steps on how to set up and run the project locally. This section will need to be filled in with specific commands for cloning the repo, installing dependencies, setting up the database, running migrations, starting the backend server, and starting the frontend development server.)*

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2.  Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
3.  Set up your PostgreSQL database and configure the connection string in a `.env` file.
4.  Run database migrations:
    ```bash
    # Example command - replace with your actual migration command
    npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
    ```
5.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
6.  Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
7.  Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

## API Documentation

Once the backend server is running, the API documentation generated by Swagger will be available at `http://localhost:<backend_port>/api-docs`.

## Frontend

The frontend application is a single-page application built with React.js. It provides the following user interfaces:

* **Authentication Pages:** Register and Login forms.
* **Wallet Dashboard:** Displays the current balance, quick action buttons (Fund Wallet, Transfer), and a transaction history table.
* **Wallet Operations:** Forms for funding the wallet and transferring funds to another user.

## Future Enhancements

*(Optional: List any potential future features or improvements you plan to add)*

* Implement pagination for transaction history.
* Add more robust form validation using libraries like Yup/Formik.
* Implement comprehensive unit tests.
* Explore adding more transaction types or features.
